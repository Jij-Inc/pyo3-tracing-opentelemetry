# pyo3-tracing-opentelemetry

Bridge Rust `tracing` and Python OpenTelemetry for seamless distributed tracing across PyO3 FFI boundaries.

## Overview

When building Python extensions with PyO3 that use Rust's `tracing` crate, you often want the spans to be exported through Python's OpenTelemetry SDK. This crate bridges that gap by:

1. Converting Rust `SpanData` to Python `ReadableSpan` objects
2. Forwarding spans to Python's configured `SpanProcessor`s
3. Propagating trace context between Python and Rust (W3C Trace Context format)

## Installation

Add to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
pyo3-tracing-opentelemetry = "0.3"
```

## Usage

See the [example crate](./example) for a complete working example.

### Rust side

```rust
use pyo3::prelude::*;
use pyo3_tracing_opentelemetry::TracingBridge;

// Create a tracing bridge as a module-level constant
const TRACING: TracingBridge = TracingBridge::new("my-service");

#[pyfunction]
fn my_traced_function(py: Python) -> PyResult<()> {
    // This ensures tracing is initialized and attaches Python's trace context
    let _guard = TRACING.attach_parent_context(py);

    // Your traced code here - spans will be forwarded to Python's exporters
    tracing::info_span!("my_operation").in_scope(|| {
        tracing::info!("doing work");
    });

    Ok(())
}
```

For advanced configuration (different service name and tracer name):

```rust
use pyo3::prelude::*;
use pyo3_tracing_opentelemetry::TracingBridge;

// Use struct literal for different service_name and tracer_name
const TRACING: TracingBridge = TracingBridge {
    service_name: "my-service",
    tracer_name: "my-tracer",
};

#[pyfunction]
fn my_traced_function(py: Python) -> PyResult<()> {
    let _guard = TRACING.attach_parent_context(py);
    // ...
    Ok(())
}
```

### Python side

```python
from opentelemetry import trace
from opentelemetry.sdk.trace import TracerProvider
from opentelemetry.sdk.trace.export import SimpleSpanProcessor, ConsoleSpanExporter

# Set up Python OpenTelemetry
provider = TracerProvider()
provider.add_span_processor(SimpleSpanProcessor(ConsoleSpanExporter()))
trace.set_tracer_provider(provider)

# Create a parent span in Python
tracer = trace.get_tracer("my-python-app")
with tracer.start_as_current_span("python-parent"):
    # Call your Rust function - Rust spans will appear as children
    my_rust_module.my_traced_function()
```

## How it works

1. When `TracingBridge::attach_parent_context(py)` is called, the crate:
   - Initializes a Rust `tracing-subscriber` with an OpenTelemetry layer (only once per process)
   - Extracts the current trace context from Python using W3C Trace Context propagation
   - Attaches that context so Rust spans become children of the Python span

2. When Rust spans complete, the `PySpanExporter`:
   - Resolves Python's **current** `TracerProvider` via `trace.get_tracer_provider()` on every span export
   - Converts `SpanData` to Python `ReadableSpan` objects
   - Calls `on_end()` on each of the provider's active span processors
   - This allows spans to flow through to any Python exporter (Jaeger, OTLP, Console, etc.), and lets the embedding application add, swap, or tear down span processors at any point during the process lifetime

> [!NOTE]
> Python's `TracerProvider` does **not** need to be configured before the first call into the bridge. If no SDK `TracerProvider` is active when a span is exported, the span is dropped silently; once a provider is installed, subsequent spans start flowing. This makes the crate work naturally for notebooks and tests that set up tracing lazily.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The Rust `tracing-subscriber` is still initialized once per process and cannot be re-initialized. If another library has already called `tracing_subscriber::set_global_default`, the bridge returns `TracingInitResult::SubscriberAlreadyInitialized` and OTel export won't work unless the embedding application wires the OpenTelemetry layer itself.

> [!NOTE]
> If multiple `TracingBridge` instances with different configurations call `attach_parent_context`, the first one wins and subsequent configurations are ignored (with a warning logged).
